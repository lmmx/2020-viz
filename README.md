# 2020-viz

From 2020, collecting interesting case studies in graphics and/or problems to be solved, in particular replicating examples found "in the wild".

Graphics (as opposed to plots) are not my strong point, but the more I've read the more it seems amenable and complementary to skillsets like matrix algebra, and Python is a perfectly well-suited language (i.e. I will not be branching out to learn Processing, nor fiddling with JavaScript or C).

For now comments are in the [issues](issues).
